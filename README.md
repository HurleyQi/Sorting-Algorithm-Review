# Sorting-Algorithm-Review


This program is intended as a review for the sorting algorithms taught in CS 314 at the University of Austin at Texas. The program will stop at a random point amid the sorting process and ask the user which of the five sorting algorithms (Selection, Insertion, Radix, Quick, Merge) is being implemented.
